# Gym Tracker ðŸ’ª

## About The Project

Gym Tracker is a fitness tracking application to track your workouts, fitness goals, and progress!

### Reason behind the project

I created this project to help escape fumbling with Excel spreadsheets or Apple notes while at the gym. I wanted something that I can just pull up and check off the exercises that I completed based on the type of workout I was doing.

## Deployment

Feel free to deploy however you would like if you don't want to use gym-tracker.app, what is reccomended though for deployment is Vercel. Their services are fantastic to use and free under a hobby account.

If you want to have steps in the README for how to deploy using vercel create an issue and someone can add those steps here.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is a list things you need to use the Gym Tracker.

-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
-   [Docker](https://docker.com)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   Current version that is targeted is v18.17.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/jessedelira/gym-tracker.git
    ```
2. Create MySQL instance using Docker
    ```sh
    $ docker run --name gym-tracker-db -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql
    ```
3. Use your database management tool of choice to create the database

    ```sh
    CREATE DATABASE gym_tracker;
    ```

4. Create .env at root of project and add the following:

    - Use this command: `$ openssl rand -base64 32` to create a NEXTAUTH_SECRET env var

    ```sh
      DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/gym_tracker"
      NEXTAUTH_SECRET="place_here"
      NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
    ```

5. Run `$ npm install` at root of project to install the dependencies
    - This will kick off the postinstall script, which will run `$ npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database tables and populate the database with seed data
6. Finally, run `$ npm run dev` to start the server

### Warnings

-   `warn Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload. Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/fast-refresh-reload`
    -   This is a known issue with Next.js and Fast Refresh. It's not a problem with the app, but rather a problem with Next.js. See [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/40184#issuecomment-1328881068) for more info.
